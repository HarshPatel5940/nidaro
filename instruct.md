This is a complex application with sensitive data. Security, data privacy (GDPR/CCPA considerations if applicable), and preventing misuse (false reporting) are paramount. The attestation system is a good step towards mitigating false reports.

**Key Considerations & Added Logic:**

1.  **Business Representation:** How is a "business" uniquely identified? PAN is good for registered entities in India, but not all businesses have one. Mobile number is less unique to a *business* (can be personal). Business Name is not unique.
    *   **Proposal:** Primarily use PAN when available. Allow reporting via Mobile Number but treat these potentially differently or require more attestations. Allow searching by Name, but link results back to PAN/Mobile.
2.  **User-Business Linkage (for "Who Reported Me"):** A user needs to *claim* ownership or representation of a business (identified by PAN/Mobile) to see reports *against* that business. This requires a verification step (e.g., verifying control of the business mobile number, or a document upload process - adds complexity).
    *   **Simplified V1:** For "Who Reported Me", initially only show reports against businesses whose registered PAN/Mobile *matches* the logged-in user's verified mobile number. This is less robust but simpler to start.
3.  **Authenticity Score:** This needs a clear definition.
    *   **Proposal:** Score = (Number of Verified Reports / Total Number of Reports) * (Average Attestations per Verified Report / 5). Add factors like age of reports, diversity of reporters (if possible without compromising anonymity). Start simple: Score = (Number of Verified Reports > 0) ? 70 + (Number of Verified Reports * 5) : 50 - (Number of Pending/Rejected Reports * 5). Clamp between 0-100. Needs refinement.
4.  **Anonymity:** The audit trail must be truly anonymous. Storing `reporter_user_id` is necessary for logic, but *never* expose it directly on the frontend search results. Maybe show a count or obfuscated identifiers ("Reporter A", "Reporter B").
5.  **Proof Handling:** Uploading files needs secure storage. Cloudflare R2 (S3 compatible) is perfect for this. Generate pre-signed URLs from the Worker for direct client uploads to R2.
6.  **Attestation Discovery:** How do users find reports to attest?
    *   **Proposal:** Add a "Pending Attestation" feed/section where users can review reports (potentially filtered by business type/location if that data is added later).
7.  **Dispute Resolution:** The "Contact Support" for invalid reports needs a workflow. A support agent (or admin) would review the report, the user's claim, and potentially communicate with the reporter/attesters before marking a report as invalid/rejected.
8.  **Rate Limiting & Security:** Implement rate limiting on the API (especially OTP requests, report submissions, attestations) using Cloudflare's features. Sanitize all inputs.
